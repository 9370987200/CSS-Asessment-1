    <h1>This is First Css Assignment</h1>
    <h3> What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for cascading Style sheets.</li><hr>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be dispayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li><del><b> Css is not neccesary</del> <span> CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b> It can control the layout of mutiple web pages at once</li>
        <li><i><u> External style sheets are stored in CSS files.</u></i></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements 1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section </li>
        <li>External - by using a link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common to add CSS , is to keep the styles in external css files . However ,<b><span> in this tutorial
            we will use inline and internal styles</span></b> , because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you 
            to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> when comparing CSS class vs ID , the difference in that CSS class applies a style to mutiple elements 
            ID , on the other hand , aplies a style to one unique element . ID is also special in that  you can use
            a special URL to link directy to an element and it's used by JavaScriprt.
        </p>
        <p>In CSS , selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page . Once an 
            element hasbeen targeted , a stye or set of styles can be applied to the eement.
        </p>
        <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID . Both are
            used to target elements to which be applied.
